# notes:
# step by step guide to building occupancy models in unmarked
#' Step 1. Extract covariates at 1km2, 5km2, and 10km2 buffers (or as chosen scale)
#' Step 2. Create a fishnet or grid, as the same size as the buffers across all Ireland, and extract covariates at this grid scale
#' Step 3. Sanity check - plot your covariates on your grid in ArcGIS - do they look right?
#' You can start building models.... But first
#' Step 4.  Write down your hypotheses for covariate effects on detection probability and occupancy based on species ecology
#' Step 5. Think about how you might combine some of the various classes in the CORINE data (for example, broadleaf + mixed forest becomes broadleaf and mixed).
#' Step 6. Build a global model - and check goodness of fit
#' Step 7. Decide on whether you are going to interpret your global model or conduct AIC-based model selection
#' Step 8. Make marginal predictions for covariates in top model (explore covariate space across range of sampled values for that covariate, while keeping all others at their mean).
#' Step 9. Make predictions for marten psi (occupancy probability) across the landscape, plot them in ArcGIS
#' Step 10. Celebrate, you did it!
