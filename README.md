# PhD Thesis: Human-Wildlife Conflict: Perception Versus Reality

## Chapter 2: All-Ireland Occupancy Modeling of Pine Martens
In Chapter 2, the study uses **occupancy modeling** to evaluate the distribution of **pine martens** across all of Ireland. The aim is to assess how habitat characteristics and human population density influence the occurrence of pine martens across all of the island of Ireland

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my PhD thesis on **Human-Wildlife Conflict: Perception Versus Reality**. The project investigates the gap between public perceptions and the actual impact of wild carnivores in Ireland, focusing specifically on **pine martens**. 

### Occupancy Modelling 

### Source Data
The data used in Chapter 2 is based on survey data collected from **(XX)**. This survey data includes:


### Methodology


## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following main directories and files:

### `/1.data`
- `raw/`: Contains raw, unprocessed survey data from **(XX)**.
- `processed/`: Includes cleaned and processed data files, ready for occupancy modeling.
- `external/`: Stores any external data sources not originally part of the primary survey data.

### `/2.notebooks`
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- `occupancy_modeling.ipynb`: Notebook for performing occupancy modeling and visualizing the results.

### `/3.scripts`
- `data_cleaning.R`: Script for preparing and cleaning the raw survey data.
- `occupancy_modeling.R`: Script for running the occupancy models.
- `model_results.R`: Script for analyzing and interpreting the occupancy model outputs.

### `/4.results`
- `figures/`: Contains plots and figures from the analysis.
- `models/`: Stores trained occupancy models and related files.
- `outputs/`: Any additional output files from the research.

### `/5.docs`
- `methodology.md`: Detailed description of the occupancy modeling methodology and survey process.
- `results_summary.md`: Summary of the research results and key findings from Chapter 2.

### Admin Files
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file, specifying terms for using the project.
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup instructions, and additional information.
